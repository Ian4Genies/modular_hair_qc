- This tool should be in the form of a Maya menu, I should be able to call a simple main script that launches this menu in maya\
- This menu and tool is designed to work from the usd directory described in [[USD_directory]]
- The maya tool should use lazy loading wherever possible to improve the speed of asset loading in maya
- Please create reusable utility scripts and property organize them
- I think for the UI and USD specifically re-usable utilities will help us expand and modify functionality in the future.
