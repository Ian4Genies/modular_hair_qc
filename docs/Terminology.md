Module: a single geometry + needed meta data, that is combined with other geometry to form a single hair style. 

Module Types: The four main categories of hair modules - scalp, crown, tail, and bang - each serving a different functional role in the complete hair system.

Group: refers to a group of modules that are meant to work together by default. These will normally come in the form of delivery buckets that must be ingested and QC'd against eachother.

Style: A single collection of modules that represent a coherent hair style. This at minimum contains a single scalp module. At maximum it contains 1 module of each type: 1 scalp, 1 crown, 1 bang, and 1 tail.
